# Which Month Benefits Both the Museum and Player the Most in *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*?
[Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vmagdangal/acnh-best-museum-month-analysis/blob/main/ACNH_Museum_Months.ipynb)

## Overview
This is a Google Colab analysis notebook, where this dataset from [Kaggle](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncrn-bird-monitoring-data-2007-2017), with the `insects.csv` file renamed to `bugs.csv`. It contains a large catalog of villagers and items from the 2020 video game *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*. However, I will only be using the CSVs that contain all of the fish and bugs. The dataset did not include information on sea creatures, so I created my own using data from [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Sea_creature/New_Horizons), a community-run wiki for all things *Animal Crossing*.

## Usage
Click into the `ACNH_Museum_Months.ipynb` file in the repository (or at the above link), and you will be able to both view the notebook or navigate into it.

If running the notebook, make sure to first upload `fish.csv`, `bugs.csv`, and `sea_creatures.csv` from `ACNH_Museum_Month_CSVs.zip` into the notebook at the commented code cell under the "Fetching Data" section.
